## Why?

The main reason I decided to build this is that I need a simple tool to reply to my "happy birthday" message. I know it is kind of blunt and rude but it would take me 2-3 days to reply to all and by that time that moment would be gone. I just need a good solution to this problem. I really don't need a full-fledged AI-BOT or BOT with NLU (or some other acronym). I believe there are many people who also have such need.

## Goals
With that in mind, I know that WBOT would need to satisfy these criteria:

* üöÄ Fast!!!
* üëç Friendly CLI UX
* üîí Does not touch user‚Äôs data
* üí∞ Free! for personal use

If you think WBOT delivers these, let me know by putting a star on this project üòâ
